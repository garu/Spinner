* MOAR LEVLZ!!! 
  So whe can organize them in a progressive order,
  making the game harder and the player experience better.

* Better speed control
  the ball circles too fast on some machines. We need to make this
  as smooth and regular as possible, otherwise game becomes 
  impossible to play.

* Menu option to choose a specific level

* High Score, with a Menu option showing it

* Implement Bounding Walls

* Implement different Wheels. Ideas:

   - gravity wheel      => attracts ball; (done! kthakore++)
   - moving wheel       => walks through a path;
   - disappearing wheel => blinking, can only be touched when visible;
   - strong wheel       => needs to be touched more than once before 
                           being disabled;
   - bomb-wheel         => once ball connects, it goes dark in 3...2...1, 
                           so you have to get out quickly!


* Implement power-ups, to be catched among flight. They would go for a short
  period of time, then everything turns back to normal. Also, while it'd be
  much easier to apply them upon the ball touching it, it might be cooler if
  the fetched item went to a bag, like the bottom bar on Mario 3. The player
  would be able to choose what and when to use each item.

   - something that makes ball really big, so it has more contact surface;
   - something that makes the game move real slow (bullett-time);
   - something that makes the ball have a "laser" pointing it to the 
     direction it will go off to;
